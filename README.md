I've added a scroll bar menu (select element) to allow users to select a product from the given options. The form also includes input fields for the serial number, voltage, warranty, quantity, and rating of the selected product.

When the user clicks the "Store Data" button, the storeProductData() JavaScript function is called. This function retrieves the values entered by the user, constructs the data array, and converts it into an Excel sheet format. The formatExcelSheet() function is a placeholder that formats the data into a basic Excel sheet format (using tab-separated values). In a real-world scenario, you can use a library like SheetJS to generate a proper Excel file.

Finally, the formatted Excel sheet is converted to Base64 format and downloaded using a dynamically created a element. The sheet is named after the selected product (with spaces replaced by hyphens) and has the .xlsx file extension.

Remember that this example provides a basic implementation and does not actually save the data to individual Excel sheets on the server. It focuses on generating and downloading the Excel sheet with the entered data.
